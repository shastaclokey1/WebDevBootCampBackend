Data Associations

* Arrays of js objects can be stored inside of mongoose schemas to "embed"
  data in the database element

* Instead of storing whole js objects inside of these database element arrays,
  we can store id's in an array that reference a js object.
    - This prevents us from using a ton of memory to store one object.
    - This allows us to store all "comment" type database elements in one
      place, then reference them from multiple other places.
      
* Using module.exports lets you make variables from a js file available for other files
    - This allows sections of code to be separated out into multiple files and required 
      by the main code using require("nameOfFile")
