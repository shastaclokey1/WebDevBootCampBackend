-Super cool description of how the internet works.
-Request information from a website and get a response back from the server.
-Back end development involves processing these requests and figuring out what to send back.
-Browser takes return information and turns it into visuals that are nice to look at.

(2) - Front end is everything that you see and interact with.
    - Front end is HTML, CSS, and JS
    - Everything else is the back end of web development.
    - Back end can use JS, python, ruby, php for coding; mongo db, node js, etc
    - Web pages that are purely front end are called static
    - Web pages that use the back end (servers and what not) to store interactive data
      are called dynamic.

(3) - HTML allows you to describe the structure of a webpage (nouns).
    - Every single webpage has HTML.
    - CSS allows you to describe the style of a webpage (adjectives).
    - JavaScript is how you add logic and computation to a webpage (verbs).
