Using Libraries

* Paper.js is a great library for adding animations to javascript projects.
	- The animations available can be created from scratch, but using paper.js let's
	  us minimize our work from roughly 50 lines per animation to less than 5

* Howler.js is another great library for adding sounds to javascript projects.

* A canvas is an html element which contains all of our animations and graphics.
