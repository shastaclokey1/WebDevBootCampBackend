Intermediate HTML

Objectives: (1) Learn how to make and structure HTML tables.
	    (2) Learn how to use the <form>, <input>, <select>, and <label> tags to 
                make validated forms.

(1) - Tables contain a <thead> and a <tbody>
    - The header and body each contain row elements <tr> with embedded row entry elements <th> for header
      and <td> for body.
    - Tables are pretty straight forward.

* Fun little trick in sublime is to use ctrl + click to make multiple cursors to type the same text in 
  multiple places.

(2) - Forms using purely html are pretty simple because they can't actually "do" anything. Html forms
      are the front end piece of the puzzle that allows webpage visitors to enter information on the site.
    - Javascript and a back end server are nessesary to do anything with the info entered in forms.
    - The <form> tag is a container that encapsulates the buttons, text input boxes, and labels you put inside.
    - The action atribute for forms lets you set the url which you want to send the data from the form to.
    - The method atribute for forms lets you specify the type of http request you want to make on activation of the form.
    - The <input> tag allows you to insert interactive controlls: text box, date specifier, color chooser, 
      file picker, etc.

    - The type atribute lets you specify which kind of input you want.
    - The <label> tag can be used to aptly label your input fields.
    - Labels can either wrap around an input element or link onto them using a for/id atribute construct.
    - Validation atributes can be used on any input field to make sure the visitor has entered info 
      into the field before hitting the submit button and to make sure that the info follows the correct
      convention for the type of input field.
    - When using radio buttons, give all the associated buttons the same "name" atribute to link them up.
    - Add a value atribute to the radio button input element to specify what to store under the name when submitted.
    - The <select> tag allows you to add a drop down menu with embedded <option> tags
