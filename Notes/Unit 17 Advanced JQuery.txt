Advanced JQuery

Objective: Learn the power of the click(), keypress(), and on() jQuery event adding methods.

[click()]
    - click(callback function) just triggers the callback whenever the attached object is clicked.
    - click() will add the callback function to every item in a list because jQuery is awesome.
    - $(this) allows you to specify the listener's calling object from within the callback.

[keydown() keyup() keypress()]
    - All three functions allow you to add a callback function to key strokes.
    - keydown() triggers when the key is pressed... down.
    - keyup() triggers when the key is released.
    - keypressed() triggers when the character is entered. Thus, shift+a would register as 
      one keypressed() callback trigger and would register the value 'A'.
    - accessing the event object within the callback function lets you access all kinds of 
      properties about the event. Do this by passing a variable to the anonymous function
      function(event){...}
