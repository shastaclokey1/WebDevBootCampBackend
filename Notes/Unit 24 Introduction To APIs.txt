Introduction To APIs

Objectives (1) What is an API?

(1) - Application Program Interfaces (APIs) allow you to grab data
      from some external webpage on the internet. 
    - In Colt's words "API's are interfaces for code/computers to 
      talk to one another"
    - HTTP is the protocol that is most widely used to acces APIs
    - APIs are actually used in all kinds of applications outside
      of webpages.
    
* ifttt.com is a cool site that lets you connect a bunch of api's 

* programmableweb.com is a huuuuuuuge list of api's on the internet.
    - the apis are nicely sorted
    - there is sometimes sample code (but not allways)
    
* tesla has an api that you can use to control music, lights, doors,
  charging port, etc through an app if you have the car's unique id.
  
* XML and JSON are two data formats used to get information with
  http requests
    - XML looks like nested html
    - json looks like nested javascript objects
    - json has become much more popular
    - json requires quotes around the keys for the key-value pairs
    
* curl is a cool command line keyword that lets you make http
  requests
  - It is more of an educational demonstration to make http requests
    from the command line
    
* eval(require(locus)) is a cool way to essentially set a breakpoint
  in your web development code. You have to install the locus
  package with npm i -D locus.
  
* `some string stuff ${variable.data} more strings` lets you 
  concatinate strings without using " " and + signs.
      - This syntax is part of a new flavor of javascript called
        es6 that I can go back and learn later. I like the syntax
        I have been using so far. It makes sense and is similar to
        the other programming languages I have learned.
