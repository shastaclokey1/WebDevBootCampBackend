jQuery

Objectives: (1) What is jQuery?
	    (2) What is a library?
	    (3) Why would you use jQuery?
	    (4) Why would you not use jQuery?

(1) - jQuery helps you select, manipulate, and create elements.
    - It has methods to add event listeners, animate elements, and add effects.
    - It can even be used to make http requests(AJAX).

(2) - A library is just a bunch of classes and methods that someone created and stuffed into
      a file that we can include in our code and utilize.

(3) - jQuery can help you keep your code more consise.
    - It will handle all the cross-browser support you would have to think about otherwise.
    - AJAx is a realllly handy tool because http requests are kindof a pain.
    - Lot's of people use jQuery which makes for great tutorials and lots of support forums.

(4) - Vanila js can do everything that jQuery can.
    - jQuery can be an unnecessarily large dependency if only used for a few things.
    - Lot's of people are moving away from it.

[jQuery Selectors]
    - The only selector in jQuery is $("selector")
    - This selector uses the css selector syntax (. for class, # for id, space for secondary specifier, no prefix for tag)
    - The .css() function allows you to style the elements you select with $()
    - This styling function can be used to specify one style and its value, a variable
      storing multiple styles, or an inline object containing style value pairs.

[jQuery Common Methods]
    - val(), text(), attr(), html(), addClass(), removeClass(), and toggleClass() are
      all common jQuery methods that I should be comfortable using.
    - text() works like the vanila js version of "text content" and allows you to view
      and change allllll the text contained in a tag (even the text in child tags).
    - html() allows you to read and update all the html contained within a tag
    - attr(attribute, newVal) can be used as a setter and attr(attribute) is a getter
    - val() gets the current value of an input or editable field. It is also a setter
    - The addClass() removeClass() and toggleClass() functions are pretty self explanatory
