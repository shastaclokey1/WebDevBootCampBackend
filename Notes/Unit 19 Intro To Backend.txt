Intro To Backend

Objectives: (1) Review Internet Basics
	    (2) Learn the difference between Static Vs. Dynamic Sites
	    (3) Brush on the Stacks/Back End Technologies we will use

(1) - Ip address of website's server location is generated from web address: www.face.com -> 23.243.55.189
    - An http request is sent to that Ip address with information about the requester and 
      information about what the request wants in return from the site at the specified ip address.
    - The server packages up the information requested in to a html/css/js document and sends it to the requester.

(2) - Static webpages contain the same html/css/js every time the page is loaded.
    - Dynamic webpages will load different html/css/js resources from a server each time a 
      page is loaded depending on the request that is recieved from users attempting to access the site.

(3) - A generic stack involves front end html/css/js resources that are supported on the
      back end by a server which is controlled with a chosen language and which utilizes a 
      chosen form of database.
    - Ex: Reddit uses python/flask to control its nginx server which utilizes a postgresql
      database to suport its html/css/js front end site.
    - stackshare.io is devoted to sharing companies' specific development stacks.
    - The stack used in this course uses node JS for its backend server scripting language,
      Express for its server, and MongoDB for its associated database. These back end pieces
      support the html/css/js front end sites we will create.
