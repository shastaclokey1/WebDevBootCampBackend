Advanced DOM Manipulation

Objectives: 

[Events]
    - Events allow you to trigger some javascript code to run when the user performs a specific action.
    - Event listeners can be attached to elements by using the method elm.addEventListener(type, callBack).
    - We still have to use our basic selectors to get object references to our elements. Then,
      we can add event listeners to those objects.
    - A click listener, "click", can be added to an element to trigger code after a click.
    - All the events you could ever want to use are on the MDN Event reference docs page.

* A great way to extract information from web pages is to use querySelectorAll to find all the elements
  of a specific type or with a specific class/id. We can then access information from these elements, or
  manipulate their content and attributes.
